# Brick Breaker 2
After creating [Brick Breaker with Windows Forms](https://github.com/KevCrisanto/BrickBreaker-Game), I decided to create the same game with a game engine, and I chose Unity.

Use the paddle in order to keep the ball in the game & hit the bricks. Your mission is to remove all the bricks by hitting them with the ball.

### Features

- Sound: Uninterrumpted background music and sounds when bricks, paddle, and walls are hit.

- Different kinds of bricks: Some bricks need to be hitted more than once. The user can see the damage after every hit.

- Effects: Added effects when a brick is destroyed.

- Levels: Several levels with different background and bricks.

### Future features

Things that I will implement in the future:

- More levels.

- Power-ups

- Story
